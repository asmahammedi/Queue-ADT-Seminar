# Queue ADT â€“ Jira Ticket Queue ðŸ§¾

This project includes a simple Python implementation of the **Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT)** using a Jira-style ticket system. The code simulates a queue where tickets are added and processed in **First-In, First-Out (FIFO) order.

It also includes a short presentation introducing Queue ADT, its variations, its basic operations, use cases, and limitations.


ðŸ§  What the Code Does

- Creates a `JiraTicketQueue` class
- Allows adding (`enqueue`) and processing (`dequeue`) tickets
- Supports checking the next (`peek`) and last (`rear`) ticket
- Includes helper methods: `isEmpty()` and `size()`
